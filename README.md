# digit-recognition
part of ML course -- for semester project of Image captioning using CNNs

the data set used is MNSIT db, a standard

the data-set is already fed, the model is trained with an accuracy of ~97%.

to view it in action, in OCTAVE/Matlab:


```
1. (Optional for getting rid of line by line view in octave) PS1('>> ');
2. Go to the directory where you have cloned it, go into the folder. Normal cd command words in Octave. 
3. ex3_nn

That's it!
You shall see randomly picked data from the dataset as a popup and the infered digit in the terminal. Enter continues it, q and Enter quits the sequence.
